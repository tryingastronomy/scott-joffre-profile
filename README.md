## Who am I?

Graduating in 2020 from Hope College with a B.S in physics and mechanical engineering, I left the sandy shores of west Michigan behind to pursue a Ph.D in physics at Clemson University. Here, I am pushing the instrument limits of the gamma-ray telescope, the Fermi Large Area Telescope, to map the 20-200 MeV sky for the first time.
